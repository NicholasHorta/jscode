<h1>Javascript and </h1>
<h3>Javascript is a high level, object oriented, multi paradigm programming language</h3>
<p>Pretty much sums up to JS is a language which can communicate commands to a computer with easier to read and manage code which can be written in various styles sent in the form of a variety of objects consisting of relevent data, all while conforming to the ECMAScript specification</p>

<h3>Considered the human body:</h3>
<p>We have our body, every part of us a representation of a defferent element but with it's own use.</p>
<p>Our HTML elements represent different parts of our structure, structural parts of our body</p>
<p>Our css is our complextions, texture, color, gradients, and animation of movement</p>
<p>And JS is the script which our brains run on that brings to life the command and response information impulses</p>

<human>
    <brain>
        <meta-data lang="en" country="Portugal" age="30" name="Nicholas">
        <logic src="mind.js"></logic>
    </brain>
    <body>
        <head>
            <hair style="color: brown; length: long; texture: smooth">Hair</hair>
            <eyes src="../visual-reality.mp4"></eyes>
        </head>
        <arms>
            <left-arm></left-arm>
            <right-arm></right-arm>
        </arms>
        <torso></torso>
        <legs></legs>
        <feet></feet>
    </body>
</human>

<p>Above we have a our HTML structure with <start> and </end> tags which represent the main sections of human being and the additional sub-sections, Within these tags, we have attributes and properties which which describe and give us definition and ability</p>
<ul>
    <li>So let's break it down top to bottom</li>  
    <li>We define the creature as human, so we've set our outline</li>
    <li>We then have two major parts of the human: Brain & Body</li>
    <li>Within those respective sections we can assign items within them relative to their function</li>
    <li>brain we have our data about us - the language we speak, the country we're from, our age and our name. These are all attributes which help identify us on a personal and social level.</li>
    <li>Our Javascript or logic is the commands or responses drawn from our mind sent to our brain which recieves the functions we provide and executes them accordingly with parameters we've set</li>
    <li>Our body is decorated with all the descriptive features which give us our attributes and animations, which can included demands of 3rd party sources such as the stream of visual content we demand, sent to our eyes, such is the tag made for that use case, and while we do not create the visual world, we can feed off of it's constant stream of data and allow access to our body to experience it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, sure that was long winded and possibly you're more confused then before, if so, my bad, It will become way clearer as we go on! If not and that made sense, awesome! Let's continue</p>
