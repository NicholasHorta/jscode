<h1>Values & Variables</h1>

<p>A value represents the smallest unit of information or data which is of a specific type</p>
<script>33; "Illuminati"; true;</script>

<p>A value is chosen by what the you plan to do with it, with brings us to the type of value we choose to use.</p>

<p>JS has TYPED values as apposed to TYPED variables as other languages have, meaning it is our value which represents the type of data we will work with.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The built in types are: </li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>Undefined</li>
    <li>Null</li>
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Symbol</li>
</ul>
<p>Values stored directly in the source code (code document) are called LITERALS</p>
<p>String literals are strings of information presented between single or double quotations '' or " ":</p>
<code>"String Literal Baby!"</code>
<p>Number literals are simply their value without any form of quotation (Or else it's then seen as a string):</p>
<code>777</code>
<p>Boolean literals, like numbers as presented without any form of quotation (Or else it's then seen as a string):</p>
<code>false</code>

<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>We can store these values and/or the result of the oprations with these values, in what we call variables within which we can use over and over again</p>
<p>we store them with meaningful labels in which we can identify and understand for use when needed</p>
<p>The conventional naming style fof variables is - camelCase: withInitialLettersAsHumps</p>
<p>You cannot: Begin with a number, letter, underscore or $</p>
<p></p>
<script>
    var nice = 69;
    var gokusPowerLevel = 'Over 9000'
    var bearsEatBeats = false
</script>

<p>Finally, if you're interested in viewing the type of data within a literal or variable, you can precede the variable or value with: typeof</p>
<code>typeof 'Smashing!'</code>
<code>typeof 404</code>
<code>typeof true</code>
